# Me
Yo. I'm a programmer and hobbyist game developer from Norway.
Over the years I've made some games and tools and such.
And while I can have all of my code on GitHub it is hard to get an overview of the tools that I have made without some better formatting.
That's what this page is here for.

## Games
You can find my games on itch.io: https://synthasmagoria.itch.io/
The source code for most games is also available from there.

## Writing
[Making up for Zig's translate-c unimplemented features](zig-translate-c-hammer.md)

## Tools
- [GMCollage](https://synthasmagoria.itch.io/gmcollage)
Hacks the Gamemaker Studio 1 compiler in order to allow for the creation of modules
- [Gamemaker Project Cleaner](https://github.com/Synthasmagoria/gamemaker-project-cleaner)
Deletes unused files from your Gamemaker project that accumulate over time
- [Gamemaker Path Corrector](https://github.com/Synthasmagoria/gamemaker-path-corrector)
Applies correct capitalization to the folders in your Gamemaker project primarily for Linux compatibility
- [Repeating Noise Texture Generator](https://github.com/Synthasmagoria/shader-texture-repeat)
Takes a fragment shader as an input and loops it using smoothstep mixing

## Game Engine extensions
- [LDtk-GMS](https://github.com/Synthasmagoria/LDtk-GMS)
Use LDtk in Gamemaker Studio 1.4. Allows for level editing while the game is running.

## Scripts / Code snippets
- [Gamemaker Signals](https://github.com/Synthasmagoria/gm-signals)
- [Gamemaker8.2 Signals](github.com/Synthasmagoria/gm8.2-signals)
A small bundle of scripts containing a minimal implementation of the obsverver pattern in Gamemaker
