# Me
Yo. I'm a programmer and hobbyist game developer from Norway.
Over the years I've made some games and tools and such.
And while I can have all of my code on GitHub it is hard to get an overview of the tools that I have made without some better formatting.
That's what this page is here for.

## Games
You can find my games on itch.io: https://synthasmagoria.itch.io/
The source code for most games is also available from there.

## Videos / presentations
I'll sometimes make videos on various topics.
They should all be on my youtube channel.
Here are the best ones:
- [Improving Gamemaker Studio 1 compile times with GMCollage](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9xO-IdB6qrk)

- [P2 Technical dev commentary](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6BTvtxywboQ)

## Writing

## Game Engine extensions
- [LDtk-GMS](https://github.com/Synthasmagoria/LDtk-GMS)
Use LDtk in Gamemaker Studio 1.4. Allows for level editing while the game is running.

## Scripts / Code snippets
